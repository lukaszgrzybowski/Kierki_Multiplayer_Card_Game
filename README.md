# Kierki_Multiplayer_Card_Game
This project is based on popular card game Kierki. My project implemets the rules and ads additional functionalities. 
You ale able to create rooms, come back to already created ones during the game and invite players to your game. 
What's more you are also able to use group chat which is directly built in into the interface of the game.
Whole project is created using JavaFx and JavaSockets.
